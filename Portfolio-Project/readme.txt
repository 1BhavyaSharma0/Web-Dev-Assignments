# Personal Portfolio Website (HTML)

This project is a single-page portfolio website built solely with **semantic HTML5**. It was created as the lab assignment for my Web Development course. The primary goal was to practice proper HTML structure, accessibility features, and form creation.

### Project Purpose

The purpose of this website is to:

1. Demonstrate the correct use of **semantic HTML tags** (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) to create a well-structured webpage.
2.Implement **internal navigation** links for smooth movement between sections.
3.Showcase technical skills using a well-structured **`<table>`** and project listings using **`<ul>`**.
4.Create a functional **contact form** using `label`, `placeholder`, and the **`required` attribute** for validation and usability.

### File and Folder Structure

The project follows a clean, organized folder structure:
portfolio-project/
├── Project.html          # The main portfolio page containing all content.
└── images/
└── profile.jpg     # Stores the profile image asset.
